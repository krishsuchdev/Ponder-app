## Development
This mobile application for iOS was built in Xcode using the Swift programming language as well as the UIKit, CoreAnimation, and CoreGraphics frameworks.

The [web counterpart](https://github.com/jackson-nestelroad/ponder-hackutd-19) was built with ReactJS.

Using the Firebase Realtime Database, the mobile and web applications are both capable of rapid data synchronization. This has allowed us to emphasize the cross-compatibility features between these two platforms.

In addition, we also focused on creating a simplistic design.
